//! Declarative action definitions.
//!
//! An [`ActionDefinition`] is the single source of truth for an action's
//! identity, body channels, planning rules, runtime gates, and completion
//! effects. Expressed as static data (plus a small [`Hooks`] struct of
//! function pointers for cases that don't fit the enum variants), it's
//! interpreted by [`GenericAction`](super::generic_action::GenericAction)
//! — one interpreter for every action, not a per-action trait impl.
//!
//! Core pattern: every `src/agent/actions/action/*.rs` exports a
//! `pub static FOO_DEF: ActionDefinition = ActionDefinition { ... };`
//! and the registry wraps each def in [`GenericAction`]. Adding a new
//! action is a struct literal plus (at most) a couple of named helper
//! functions when the declarative machinery doesn't cover the logic.
