# Layer 9: User Interface & Visualization

How the user sees these invisible systems without breaking immersion.

## 9A. Dynamic Analytical Layers
"Kingdoms" don't exist in code—they are visualized on demand.

**The "Kingdom Map" Algorithm:**
1.  **Cluster**: Identify Warlords with >5 vassals.
2.  **Paint**: Color regions based on *Effective Tax Range* (where the Warlord can enforce will).
3.  **The "Paper Map" Mode (Fog of Truth)**:
    - Shows what the *King claims* is his land, not the reality.
    - The player sees "Blue Territory," but units there might attack them because they are actually rebels. The UI shows the **Claim**, the gameplay shows the **Reality**.

## 9B. The "Gossip Cloud"
Replaces the standard "Event Log".

**Mechanic:**
- Displays floating text clouds over settlements.
- **Visual Coding**:
    - **Bold/Crisp**: High Fidelity Facts ("Wheat harvest is up").
    - **Faded/Wobbly**: Low Fidelity Rumors ("The dragon is coming?").
- **Player Interaction**: Player can pay Spies to "Verify" rumors, turning Faded text into Bold text (or deleting false rumors).

## 9C. Social Graph Lens
Overlay showing invisible connection lines between agents.
- **Green Line**: Trust bond (Thickness = strength).
- **Red Jagged Line**: Vendetta/Hatred.
- **Golden Handcuffs**: Debt bond (Agent A is dragged by Agent B).
- **Pulse Effect**: Visible pulses travel down lines when agents interact.
    - **Purple Pulse**: A lie/manipulation (only visible with High Perception or Debug Mode).
